what's day to day work at cerner?


    sure, Let me tell what our team do, then I'll talk about my responsibilities.

    Cerner is health care it, from the software used in hospital to the insurance financials in the background.
    
    what our team does? we give the clinets to write there write/update rules. Basically a rules engine. 

    After that we deliver some standalone tools for clients. and to support this we have some web services running in the background.


    so we delever some standaalnoetools to clients and deploy web services.

    here comes our responsibilities:

    we deliver this stand alone tools  using CHEF and deploy web services with the help containerazation.in AWS. 

    there are a few tools which are used by clients like:

    Tibco  Bisuness events which is complete built on Eclipse.
    kibana to check the outputs
    and a web application to deploy the modified application


    and web services are straight frwd. its a spring boot application. we build docker images and 
    push them to AWS whicha are in elastic container services. These are deployed in multiple avalibility zones in a private subnet.
    These services are horizontally scaled based on the metrics of CPU usage and some other factors.
